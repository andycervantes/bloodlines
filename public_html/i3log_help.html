    <h1>HELP!</h1>

    <p>So, it occured to me today, that my i3 log page seems to be useful to people, but
    since I'm not a graphics guy, the UI is probably impossible for anyone but me to
    understand.</p>

    <p>To address that, here's a quick overview of how things work.</p>

    <h3><a href="javascript:;" onmousedown="toggleDiv('defaults');">Defaults:</a></h3>
    <div id="defaults" style="display: block;">
    When you first load the page, it defaults to showing the current view of the
    most recent logs from all channels, excluding known "bots".  The default view is
    HTML.
    </div>

    <h3><a href="javascript:;" onmousedown="toggleDiv('versions');">Alternate Versions:</a></h3>
    <div id="versions" style="display: block;">
    A text version is also available, as is a JSON data dump, and an RSS feed, all
    accessed by the icons/links along the center bottom edge of the display.  The RSS
    feed has only been tested with firefox, and with my old Logitech LCD keyboard.
    </div>

    <h3><a href="javascript:;" onmousedown="toggleDiv('nav');">Navigation:</a></h3>
    <div id="nav" style="display: block;">
    <p>The navigation bar sits above the actual data, and has 14 icons.  The leftmost 4
    navigate backwards in time, going back 1, 10, or 100 pages at a time, or the far left
    taking you to page 1.  The rightmost 4 work the same way for going forwards.  If one
    of them is not available (dimmed out), it means you're closer than that many pages
    from either end.</p>

    <p>The center icon is the HOME icon.  It takes you back to the default configuration,
    as if you'd just shown up.  Most current page, no options selected.</p>

    <p>The "world" icon toggles the display of ONLY messages which contained hyperlinks.
    If lit, you will only see messages with links in them.  If dimmed, you see all
    messages.  It defaults to all messages.</p>

    <p>The cog-wheel icon toggles the display of BOT messages.  Several people run
    I3 news feeds and similar things, which can be quite spammy.  Most people checking the
    log page seem to want see what people have said, not bots... so this is also disabled
    by default.  As above, lit means show bots, dimmed means don't show them.</p>

    <p>The pie chart shows the people who have been talking the most on I3, by today, this week,
    this month, or this year.  Talk more, get pie.  The Bar icon shows a bar chart of channel
    activity, done the same way, just broken down by channel instead of speaker.</p>
    </div>

    <h3><a href="javascript:;" onmousedown="toggleDiv('filter');">Filtering:</a></h3>
    <div id="filter" style="display: block;">

    <p>There is a search box up along the top right edge.  If you type stuff in, it will try
    to filter the messages based so it has what you typed.  A '*' is a wildcard, but it
    probably doesn't quite work as you'd expect.  Someday I may sit down and make it a
    little more predictable... </p>

    <p>The meat of the interface is, of course, the actual message display section.  If you
    move your mouse around, you'll notice some columns will highlight as the mouse moves over
    them.  In particular, the Date, Time, Channel, and Speaker columns.  If you click on a
    channel or speaker, you will set a filter that limits the message display to only that
    channel or speaker.  Someday, I'd like to allow multiple clicks to select multiple
    channels or speakers, but for now... you get all or just one.</p>

    <p>Once you've selected a channel or speaker, you'll notice that column no longer highlights.
    That's because it now will have ONLY a single value which you've already selected.  No point
    in re-selecting it again.  To clear it, you might notice the column header has now become an
    active link.. click on that, and it wipes the filter.</p>

    <p>Date and Time work the same way, but instead of a filter, they set a starting date.
    The two columns are linked, so clicking on a row in either one will select the date and
    time shown as the starting date.  Once selected, only data newer than that row will show
    up until you clear it via the column header.</p>
    </div>

    <h3><a href="javascript:;" onmousedown="toggleDiv('why');">Why is that useful?</a></h3>
    <div id="filter" style="display: block;">
        <p>So, you're thinking... why is that even useful?  If I'm already AT a date, why would
        I want to select stuff from that date forward?  I can already SEE stuff from there
        forward, right?</p>

        <p>Sure you can.  But where it comes in handy is when you want to find something
        somebody said and then follow the conversation from that point.  For example, if
        that idiot Quixadhal@Bloodlines said something about pants, you could (in theory)
        select Quixadhal@Bloodlines for the speaker filter, then search for "pants", then
        select the date/time of that row, and then clear the search field.  Voila!  You can
        now follow the conversation from pants onward.</p>
