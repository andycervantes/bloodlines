History ([50:"reply the telnet link currently goes to Ye Olde Diku, as the LP isn't really even started yet, but I figured that's a good back cover sort of summary.",49:"reply Yeah, I'm happy with that one too.",48:"tell Kayle@SithWars How's this for a cheesy new web page?  http://www.shadowlord.org:8088/~bloodlines/",47:"ig Incidentally, whenever Kali checks the backscroll... time.windows.com fails to synchronize.  I was wondering why my local clock was almost a minute off, changed it to sync with my local time server and it works fine. :)",46:"ig Crat doesn't like the purity of rokb& to be distrubed by other games.",45:"ig EVE doesn't have airlocks.  Everywhere is in vacuum, since every pilot is in a pod filled with goo. :)",44:"ig Heh.  I'm picturing a pair of ultralights circline each other over a small lake, with each pilot throwing rocks at the other to try and poke enough holes in the parasails to force them to crash into the water.",43:"ig Speak not the name of the horrible FFXI login system, lest it devour your soul!!!",42:"ig Pretty much.  You can build them in empire space, but they can't use jump gates, and you can't form a cyno field in high-sec... so if you build a dread, it's stuck in that system forever.",41:"ig That's the usual way to deal with it, unless they're actully good.  Good PvP corps will have spy corps set up to track targets and get the war deccers to all log in and jump someone within a matter of minutes.",40:"ig It means your PvP side will have to buy minerals and resources that your industrial side would normally provide, and it also means non-PvP corp members have to sit on their hands and not do their normal activities unless they're willing to risk a PvP engagement.",39:"ig The point is mostly to annoy.  By declaring war, they effectively stop your industrial members from being able to operate.",38:"ig Heck, even if you just doubled it every week from where it starts now, few would try to maintain it beyond a month.  But yeah, the prices were set back when 10M ISK was a significan amount of money.",37:"ig wardecs are far too cheap to maintain in EVE.  If it were a progressive scale, where each week doubled in cost, it would be much more fair.",36:"ig The quote from the UPOP guys was \"for the lulz\".",35:"ig More like annoyance.",34:"ig Ice mining while watching TV is probably a bad idea. *grin*",33:"ig I'd just get intel on them, put them all in your \"friends\" lists, and watch to see if any come online.",32:"ig The last wardec we had (upoop), they pretty much just hung around amarr and ryavayed, so if you went a few jumps away you could do whatever you wanted.",31:"ig How competent are the attackers?  Do they actually use agents to hunt you down, or just hang around your home stations and lurk?",30:"ig Guess you need to start strip mining some belts then. :)",29:"ig Well, there ya go!  You're all set.",28:"ig Several for 50M in Jita.",27:"ig Oh, sorry... wrong side.  55M ISK.  You can sell one quickly for about 42M. :)",26:"ig Looks like you can get a noctis for about 42M ISK... cheaper than I expected.",25:"ig I wondered if they'd add something along those lines.  The orca does quite nicely for tractoring in jet cans while mining, but it can only have the one tractor mounted.",24:"ig I think that officially puts all the eggs back in the auto industry basket.  I can smell the bodies burning already.",23:"ig Our governor is pretty stupid.  He's killing the ONE thing Grannyholm did right, the tax credits for movie filming... so, several movies who were ready to film are going elsewhere.  Way to create jobs and generate revenue there Sindely.",22:"ig Good job Kayle!",21:"ig Most of them didn't do research, so they had no need of the protection.",20:"ig The only people who need tenure are those who are doing research that might yield results that are not popular with their bosses.  At my university, that would have been about 1/4 of the full professors there.",19:"ig Rango apparently fared much better... 89% critics, 76% users.",18:"ig Rotten gives Hood 12% by critical review, and 55% of viewers liked it.",17:"ig What does Rotten Tomatoes say?",16:"ig xz is the new cyborg chromosome, right?",15:"ig I hate spurious button clicks.",14:"ig http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vSkXNM1XUQ",13:"dchat Grrrrr, stupid mouse... autob& for a bit. :)",12:"dchat Probalby my favorite boc song:  sip> Cratylus@Dead Souls Dev: then fucken *boats* on top of houses",11:"ig Heh, we'd have people getting the last can of peas and then going to the back of the line and selling it for $1000.",10:"dchat Heh. :)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D18q1y57pdc",9:"dchat Kali's corporate theme song:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTZBG1-Sfto ;)",8:"ig http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_-5ZEIsQJM",7:"ig /earth is 98% full.  Kick someone in the nuts today.",6:"dchat http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfmrHTdXgK4",5:"dchat No, losing your hair is another sign of radiation poisoning.",4:"dchat That's the first sign.  Is anyone at your workplace losing their hair?",3:"dchat http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0b_zo3puzc",2:"dchat First video banned by MTV for being \"too explicit\" -- Yet it's certainly PG-13 by today's standards.",1:"dchat You probably also never got to see music videos on MTV.",0:"dchat Oh yeah, I forgot you kids never got to hear radio when the commercialism was thinly veiled.",])
