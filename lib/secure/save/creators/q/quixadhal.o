I used a standard .o file for the data. I have no method for corrupt .os. that would be very bad. however, I could always return the player to their backup state from the previous day, by copying from my daily backup.","2012.05.11-13.08,19 %^BOLD%^RED%^You tell Detah@Dead Souls Dev:%^RESET%^ I don't mind the player files so much, as they just affect individuals.
