Maybe I was a cormorant fisher. I'm  already on my third fortress. On the first one I lost two dwarves almost  immediately to mobs I was never actually able to identify. On the  second my water sources all froze, I couldn't figure out how to melt  them, and my dwarves started dying of thirst because I didn't have  enough alcohol to get them through the winter. I might run out of food  on the current one. I don't have enough seeds, I think because I forgot  to tell the chef-dwarf that it wasn't okay to cook them. Man, dwarves  are jerks.\".%^RESET%^\"",}),])
