History ([50:"ig This foreign policy is too hot!  This foreign policy is too cold...",49:"ig Interesting.  Vx is a redundant number, but I'm not sure if it's a legal number.",48:"ig We need to get Ix and Vx in a cage match.",47:"dchat If you knew lots about how the driver worked, you coudl probably simulate it with a gdb script, but then if you know that much, you probably don't NEED it. :)",46:"dchat I was thinking more along the lines of a debug mode, where it would print the object/function names as they were executed (or the object names as they were compiled).  That way, you could start the driver and know exactly what gets called as it happens, or make it a efun/kfun that can toggle this logging on and off as needed.  Obviously, it'd slow things down but it would make debugging (or just learning how stuff works) quite a bit easier.",45:"dchat Here's an intresting (to me) question.... do either dgd or fluffos have a way to force the driver to print what lpc function is currently being compiled and/or run to a debug log?  It occured to me, that would be rather handy to see the order things happen in, without having to fill your lpc code with tons of \"Here I am\" statements.",44:"free_speech or aren't white.",43:"ig I think getting a concealed carry permit in Texas pretty much involves you putting a hand on the bible and swearing to not shoot people, unless they really deserve it.",42:"ig LOL, Ninja, Texas is about to pass a bill to allow guns on college campuses.",41:"ig They used to have to actually write out documents by hand, rather than pressing \"print\" and letting the laser printer use both trays to spew it out. :)",40:"ig Actually, I bet the consititution + all amendments + the bill of rights, combined, is fewer pages than most of the pork bills that get passed in congress every day.",39:"ig Well, that's ok.  Nothing in the constitution prevents a mountain of red tape... :(",38:"ig Being a clear violation of the second amendment, I would have expected it to be shot down by now.",37:"ig So, DC's ban on guns hasn't been overturned yet?",36:"mudlist blood",35:"ig Smoked sausage, wrapped in bacon, is a good idea.",34:"ig If you want a good flight sim for space, Indepandce War 2 did a nice job of simulating newtonian physics, so you could spin your ship around to shoot while continuing to move along your given vector.",33:"ig To stop, you rotate 180 degrees on either axis, and then thurst. :)",32:"ig So, to turn right, you rotate clockwise 90 degrees, then rotate up 90 degrees, then thrust.",31:"ig One of the fun things in Elite was learning to fly by rotation.  You could spin your ship along the Y or Z axis, but could only thrust forward on the X axis.",30:"ig Correct.  All it does is change your attitude, which might be useful to use side maneuvering thrusters, but it won't (by itself) change your trajectory.",29:"ig Does Star fox have x-wings and silly people who like the title \"Darth\"?",28:"ig LOL, a barrel roll is an evasive maneuvar for ships flying in atmosphere, where gravity alters your trajectory as your lift diminishes when your wing surfaces become vertical.  It doesn't do much in space.  Stupid Star Wars people.",27:"ig Makes me wonder why they don't make a two-way pager.",26:"ig No, mostly I plug my cell phone in and watch the battery charge thing.",25:"ig You know, one that you only have to charge every 3 or 4 days, and it actually gets decent reception when using it to make calls?",24:"ig So, what's a good cell phone that actually makes calls, these days?",23:"ig Purple Gonad Rub?",22:"ig Putrid gastrointestinal roids?",21:"ig Plaid Gangsta Reeboks?",20:"ig Only one?",19:"ig Only real similarity between a neighborhood and a country is that people live there.  A neighborhood isn't soverign (well, mine isn't).  Hence they are subject to the laws of the city/county/state/country they're contined within.  Domestic violence is against the laws of this country, and so you are free to report it and expect the cops to do something.  If Libya has no such laws, how is it our business to enforce them?  If they do, isn't it their own business to enforce them?",18:"reply No worries, got a sammich while you wound down. :)",17:"ig No, you're trying to twist the simple question to make your position look righteous.  Sorry, not playing that game.",16:"ig If you get a kick out of playing God and messing with the lives of others, I'm happy for you.",15:"ig I won't let you put words in my mouth.  Read my response and interpret as you like.",14:"ig Not because of embarassment.  So, you decide you're a do-gooder and want to intervene.  You get the cops to show up and stop the fight.  So, while that fight might have been the end of it... they might have made up and talked it out, or maybe gotten a divorce... becaue of YOUR interference, now it simmers under the surface.  Next year, one of them whips out a shotgun and kills everyone because they kept it bottled up to avoid having the cops called again.  Do you feel your actions were still \"good\"?",13:"ig If they're being overly loud, I'd call the cops for disturbing the peace to make them shut the hell up, but it's not my place to play guessing games about their relationship.",12:"ig How do I know if they're fighting to kill each other, or fighting to let off steam, or fighting because it turns them on?",11:"ig It's \"wrong\" to let your neighbors fight, even if they're just blowing off steam... but it's \"okay\" to let people starve on the streets?",10:"ig If you aren't God, you have no place judging another country just because you don't like the way they do things.",9:"ig Are you god?",8:"ig Yes, there were countries backing both sides, actually.",7:"ig It's not my place to judge another soverign country's actions.  If their people don't like it, they can stage a revolution.  If they fail, they didn't hate it enough.",6:"ig 30 years isn't that long Sini.  Heck, I would have considered Libya to be a stable part of the middle east, and letting the lawful government squash a rebellion seems better for the region as a whole, than trying to play king-maker and toppling the ruler to see if someone better takes his place.",5:"ig Yep.  As far as I'm concerned, a soverign country has the right to do whatever it wants to do within their own borders.  If they join the UN, then they have to agree to follow the UN's rules.  If they don't, the UN has no juristiction.",4:"ig The UN has no right to interfere in any country that isn't part of their club.",3:"ig AFAIK, Libya isn't a member of the UN, so there's no reason they have to abide by their rules.",2:"ig Yep, and their his slaves/fodder, to do with as he pleases.",1:"ig Nothing he hasn't been doing for 30 years, Xyzzy.  It's just this time we thought the rebels might win.",0:"ig I wouldn't like that.  Just like if you want to level to the top by killing billions of chickens, if I want to be an expert swordsman at level 1, I should be able to. :)",])
