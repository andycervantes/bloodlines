History ([50:"ig How many experimental chemical exhausts are in your city?  I live in the town where Rogaine was invented, by a compnay purchased by the inventors of Viagra.  I'm pretty sure breathing is a higher risk than using a cell phone.",49:"ig Yeah, breathing increases your risk of cancer too.",48:"ig LOLblootoofers",47:"ig I wish I could... alas, the golden rye is one of their many \"test batches\", meaning they don't bottle it and you can only get it for a couple weeks at the pub.",46:"ig I'm not usualy an IPA fan (too dry), but Bell's made a realy nice golden rye ale this summer that was excellent.  Looks like it might be tasty. :)",45:"ig You drank something stronger than Bud Light?",44:"ig They have rokb& in Colorado?  Brokeback Guitar?",43:"ig *chuckle*  Ok, I'll just finish moving my mining stuff and call it good until I get more free time (or some spare cash). :)",42:"ig Interesting.",41:"ig Could you tell that he hooked up a drum machine to play against you? *grin*",40:"ig ROK = MC(Hammer)^2",39:"ig Hell's Kitchen is starting, for those who enjoy watching Gordon Ramsey tell people how stupid they are. :)",38:"admin :checks an emote afterwards.",37:"update -r chat.c",36:"cd /secure/daemon",35:"admin :checks an emote.",34:"eval return TERMINAL_D;",33:"ig He's just marking his territory, they do that if you don't get them fixed.",32:"ig So, to check email he has to have both a correct password AND provide a DNA sample?",31:"dchat Hey, he said \"partially breathe\", so I want to know what that means.  Do those races have to have a dialisys kind of external blood filtering that injects oxygen?  What else, besides breathing, supplies to oxygen they need to operate?  Note I use oxygen, but in reality I mean whatever gas/liquid they breathe, which could be methane or something else.",30:"dchat That's fully breathing, not partially breathing.",29:"dchat So, if you only partially breathe, how do you get the rest of your oxygen?",28:"ig GW was pretty basic.",27:"ig C64 used a 6510 (6502 with a few extra instructions).  Amiga used a 68000, which was awesome.",26:"ig I miss Motorola.",25:"ig But the editor was cool, color syntax highlighting and everything.",24:"ig You think you have to wait for stuff to compile.... imagine having to swap disks between compiling and linking.",23:"ig I actually got a C compiler for it too.",22:"ig I had a C64.  So, of course, I learned BASIC and wrote my own assembler.",21:"ig This would have been... 85?",20:"ig Seperate keyboards, woot!",19:"ig Or Model 4, we had a couple of those.",18:"ig I wonder if they made a Haskell system for the TRS-80 Model 3.",17:"ig My high school \"computer\" teacher was actually the math teacher.  He didn't understand GOSUB.",16:"ig I learned BASIC first, then assembly, and as a result I was one of about 5 people in my Pascal class who didn't have a problem understanding pointers. :)",15:"ig You'll never write anything complicated or useful in assembly (unless you get a job writing device drivers or embedded systems), but if you learn assembly you understand how stuff really works, as opposed to all the kiddies who think \"my $f = 3.443;\" is magic.",14:"ig My first choice is, of course, assembly language.",13:"ig As such, it's the second best thing to use, if you want to learn how to program IMO.",12:"ig Cool, glad you like it.  Lots of folk sneer at perl because you can write really BAD code with it, but... unlike C++ and other \"elitist\" languages, it was designed to just get stuff done, rather than enforce good habits and proper code style on you.",11:"ig I'm actually looking at Android phones, trying to decide what to get to replace my crApple.",10:"ig Since the first time I heard of the function was ... 8 minutes ago, I wouldn't rule out you being correct just yet.",9:"ig findfun SetUnique is handy BTW.",8:"ig But feel free to poke around more to see if that's true.",7:"ig Just guessing strictly on the function names, it sounds like SetUnique means \"mark this as a unique object\", and how many of them you can have depends on SetMaxClones().",6:"ig However, that thing may divvy stuff up by domain (based on object path).  If not, you could make it do so I bet. :)",5:"ig It doesn't look like it cares about domains at all, as it talks to UNIQUE_D.",4:"ig Glancing at /lib/props/uniqueness, I guess it depends on what SetRetain does, and how/if you're using SetMaxClones.",3:"findfun SetUnique",2:"findfunc SetUnique",1:"ig Hmmmm, the man page doesn't say.",0:"man SetUnique",])
