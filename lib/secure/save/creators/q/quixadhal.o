You paid for each room, for each description, and paid maintenance on it.  You also had to hire guards and pay them.",44:"dchat In WileyMUD, our \"endgame\" was a dev-sponsored hand-run quest to find the key to your keep.  Once you hit max level, a dev would design a keep for you and place it somewhere in the world, and then also hide the key to it.  They'd give you a few hints, but otherwise you had to find it yourself.",43:"dchat http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=qq",42:"dchat locks are not sufficient.  If I'm wealthy, I want guards who will try to kill anyone who breaks into my house.",41:"dchat However you do it, make sure your players realize this.  It's not normal for muds, and there will be much QQ if somebody logs in after being gone a week and finds their stuff gone.",40:"dchat So their avatar always needs to be present and vulnerable in some way.  Maybe they have to rent a room and hire guards to protect their stuff... or camp out in the wilderness and hope nobody finds them... or something.",39:"dchat It would be unfair for someone to gather up all the diamonds in a large chunk of the world and log off, making them inaccessible to anyone else.",38:"dchat If you really want a closed economy, you will need to have player avatars always present in the world.",37:"dchat Literally, you will have people macro \"north\" to \"go north; /for 1 50 gather roots;\"",36:"dchat That's fine, but realize two things... (1) they always want as many as they can get, and (2) if they know they can harvest multiple times to get more, they will sit there and macro doing the gather command 50 times.",35:"dchat The goal of UI design is to make it as easy as possible for the user to accompish what they're trying to do.  Not only should \"get pot shards\" work with 1 item, but \"get pot shard\" should return as many as they can gather.  Plurality should, in fact, not be a factor for most of the interface.  The exception being buying/selling/trading, in which case you expect to always do 1 item unless you specify a quantity or \"all\".",34:"dchat ...

If a particle decays, emit radiation and adjust mass accordingly.",26:"ig Heh... My first programming job was a 50 minute commute.

Maybe I was a cormorant fisher. I'm  already on my third fortress. On the first one I lost two dwarves almost  immediately to mobs I was never actually able to identify. On the  second my water sources all froze, I couldn't figure out how to melt  them, and my dwarves started dying of thirst because I didn't have  enough alcohol to get them through the winter. I might run out of food  on the current one. I don't have enough seeds, I think because I forgot  to tell the chef-dwarf that it wasn't okay to cook them.
