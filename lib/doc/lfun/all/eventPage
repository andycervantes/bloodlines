EVENTPAGE

NAME
        eventPage()

SYNOPSIS
        varargs mixed eventPage(mixed val, mixed msg_class, function f,mixed args...)

DESCRIPTION
        This routine takes an array of lines and emits them to the player, pausing at a prompt after a number of lines based on their terminal pager settings.  This is obtained via GetScreen()[1].  If the argument passed is a string, it is assumed to be a filename, and the contents of that file are read in and sent.
        Additional details about message classes, and what functions are likely to be useful should be added here.

EXAMPLES
        this_player()->eventPage( explode( "Wall of Text!", "\n" ) );

LOCATION
        /lib/pager.c
