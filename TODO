Come up with a revised world-map of WileyMUD that looks
more like it was a real place, rather than just random areas
thrown together as they evolved.

Redo Shylar so it's a proper large city (like Highstaff)
and create a newbie tutorial that shows you where all the
important places are.

Make combat work like it does in WileyMUD, that is to say
mostly like AD&D.

Create a crafting system like EQ2, and tie materials into
the combat system, so gear can inherit properties from 
the components used to make it.
